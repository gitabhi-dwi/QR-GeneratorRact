# QR-GeneratorRact

Our app consists of two sections. In the first section, we will collect user inputs such as the text to encode, the size of the QR code, and the background color of the QR code, and store these inputs in state variables. Subsequently, we will construct the necessary API string to fetch the QR code image. In the second section, we will display the generated QR code.
